  /** Humanoid agent base class
   *
   * This class forms the base of your humanoid 3D soccer simulation
   * agent. All you need to do to create a working agent is derive
   * from this class. For instance:
   *
   * \code
   * class MyAgent : public bats::HumanoidAgent
   * {
   *   public:
   *     MyAgent(std::string teamName) : bats::HumanoidAgent(teamName) {}
   * };
   * \endcode
   *
   * To start your agent, simply create an object of your agent class
   * and call its run method:
   *
   * \code
   * int main()
   * {
   *   MyAgent agent("MyTeam");
   *   agent.run();
   * }
   * \endcode
   *
   * The HumanoidAgent class handles all the communication with the
   * server and parsing of input by using SocketComm and
   * WorldModel. You can implement the behavior for your agent by
   * overloading the think method. If your agent needs initialization
   * code that should be run once at start up, overload the init
   * method.
